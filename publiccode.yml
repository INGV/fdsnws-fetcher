    shortDescription: >-
      Docker used to retrieve "resp", "dless", "sac", "minified", "paz" or
      "dataselect_list" from FDSN node.
    documentation: 'https://github.com/INGV/fdsnws-fetcher/blob/master/README.md'
    longDescription: >
      This project is developed to interact with "station" and "dataselect" FDSN
      (https://www.fdsn.org) Web Services:


      - the "station" WS is used to retrieve station metadata:
      https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=11

      - the "dataselect" WS is used to retrieve seismic waveform:
      https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.2.pdf#page=9


      It is developed using docker technology and implements a set of software,
      tools and script to find seismic stations by geographic constrain and time
      window.


      The output is RAW data like seismic "waveforms" in MSEED format or
      metadata like response function in "SAC", "RESP" or "PAZ" (Poles and
      Zeros) format.
